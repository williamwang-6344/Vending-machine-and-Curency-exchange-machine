# Technical Report

## GitHub Collaboration

There is one GitHub repository for this project. All the group members are administrators of the repository.

#### Branches

There are plenty of branches in the repository. The main branch is `main`. The `main` branch is protected. It can only be merged by pull requests. The pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other group member. The pull requests must pass all the tests before they can be merged.

#### Project Boards

We created a board to arrange all the tasks. Each task is an issue and assigned to a group member. The board is divided into three parts: `To do`, `In progress` and `Done`.

#### Issues

We created issues for each task. Each issue is assigned to a group member. We also added labels to each issue to indicate the type of the task. For example, we added `bug` label to the issue that we found a bug in the code. We also added `enhancement` label to the issue that we need to improve the code.

#### Pull Requests

We all worked on our own branches. When we finished a task, we created a pull request to merge our branch to the main branch. We also added labels to each pull request to indicate the type of the task. For example, we added `bug` label to the pull request that we fixed a bug in the code. We also added `enhancement` label to the pull request that we improved the code. When a pull request is opened, we requested a review from another group member. The pull request will be merged after the reviewer approved the pull request. We also added a comment to the pull request to indicate the task that the pull request is for.

#### Commits

We all worked on our own branches. When we finished a task, we committed our changes to the branch. We also added comments to each commit to indicate the task that the commit is for.

#### Merge Conflicts

We all worked on our own branches. When we finished a task, we created a pull request to merge our branch to the main branch. When we created a pull request, we checked if there is a merge conflict. If there is a merge conflict, we fixed the merge conflict and merged the pull request.

There is once that a group member make changes before pull the code from main, so some of the code is not updated. When the group member tried to merge the code, there is a merge conflict. We had reverted the code and pull the code from main again. Then we merged the code again.

## Gradle

We used Gradle to build the project and run the tests. 

#### Build

## JUnit

We used JUnit to test the code.

#### Test

#### Code Coverage

We used JaCoCo to measure the code coverage. The code coverage is 100%.

## Jenkins Integration

We used Jenkins to run the tests automatically. We also used Jenkins to measure the code coverage. The code coverage is 100%.
